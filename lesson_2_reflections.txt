What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git init creates a new empty repository, and prepares it for tracking files that are subsequently added to it. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
You cannot work on files in the staging area, but they are not part of the repository. They can be overwritten or deleted in preparation for committal. This offers a way to prepare, review, and modify a commit candidate before it is actually committed.
