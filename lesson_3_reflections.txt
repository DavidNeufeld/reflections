When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repos are used when publishing your own work, fetching others published work, and for collaborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Automatically pulling changes from a remote would result in constantly having to spend effort merging changes on the remote with the local tracked branches, instead of developing your own branches and merging with the remote on your own terms. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are divergent development paths within the same repository that may merge back into the repository. Clones are local copies of remote repositories that can be manually synchronised with the remote using pull and push requests. Forks are remote copies of other remote repositories that are not intended for synchronization between the remotes. Clones of forked repositories can be synchronized with the forked remoted without being synchronized with the repository the original remote of the forked remote.
